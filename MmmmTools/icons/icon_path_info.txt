XBMLANGPATH

    This variable specifies the location of icon files, such as icons used for Shelf buttons. On Linux, the syntax is slightly different then other paths. For example:

    XBMLANGPATH = "./icons/%B:$HOME/dev/icons/%B"

    In this example, %B is acts as a placeholder that will be replaced by Maya with the bitmap filename.

    In addition, for each module file found by Maya on startup, the icons subdirectory of the module's root directory ('icons/%B on Linus) will be added to XBMLANGPATH. See the description of the MAYA_MODULE_PATH variable above and Distributing Multi-File Modules for more information.

    The following table lists the default paths, which will always follow any path that you specify.
