MmmmTools - Usability Improvements for Maya

See the module __init__.py source code files, which includes
notes on the conventions used in MmmmTools.

#### Notes ###

Conventions used:

    indentation with space, 4 spaces per tab (python standard)

    
    several short variable names are commonly used for the same thing
    often shortcuts are created locally, for example:
    u is used for utils (very simple common functions in Utils)
        u.log("log this")
    U is also for utils
        this is actually better and more accurate since U is a class
        and thus should be uppercase. Most code using 'u' should become 'U'.
    objs for simple obj lists
        for obj in objs:
    obj for object, usually from objs list
        for obj in objs:
    i,j,i1,i2,j1,j2 for numerical iterators
        for i in range(10):    
    v for values
        for v in listOfValues
    k for keys
        for k,v in dictOfItems.items():
    s for self
        s = self
        This is often used in functions to shorten the code

    d for data, usually a dictionary
    
    
    upper camel case
        modules, classes, static methods and members
    lower camel case
        local variable and instance members and methods 

        
    Longer, descriptive names are used non locally, but often short names are used locally
        This makes the code way easier to type and read.
        Generally, when a short "local" variable is used, if will be defined just a little bit earlier
        (except for u, which is the Utils class that is used so often it has a standard short variable name

    The main class from most modules is named the same as the module itself
        Use of an example module and an example class would be as follows:
            from Example import Example
            example = Example()
    
    
    The maya conventions are used for the Maya modules:
        import maya.cmds as cmds
        import pymel.all as pm
        
        This is done even though it is inconsistent because it's important to
        remain consistent with standard documentation for maya and pymel
        
    Try to split complex statements (lines) up into a series of simpler
    statements to make them easier to follow.
    This is usually preferred unless a single line
    is actually easier to understand and follow

    Comments are often added to explain the syntax and usage so that
    beginners can look at the code and understand it quickly.
    MmmmTools is intended to teach students by example.
    
    
    Commonly used classes:
    
        Duck, a simple class inheriting from Object
        Object, a simple class inheriting from object
            object does allow setattr so even if you add no members or methods
            it is useful to derive a class from it, such as Object or Duck

To Do - Roadmap and Planning:

    Fix Linux error  where can't add to slots in unipath abstract path class
      why does this work on windows???

    GenericScriptable python node
    Programmable node - node with properties to hold a string contains
        code which runs on each callback (one string property per callback)
        This essentially creates the most flexible node possible and allows
        the contents to be stored in the scene itself

    Notes Manager - Use annotation objects for notes
    
    Script Object Runner - Use notes in object as script code as run
    
    Expression Manager - Run expressions via python

    Set project by path from clipboard, or by entered text
        perhaps text box can be filled with clipboard text
        automatically

    Renamer - Write custom object renamer, with support for regular
              expressions
                Prefix
                Suffix
                Numbering
                Padding
                
              
    Selector - Write Selector tools
                Filter selection would select subsets of components
                    lights, cameras, geo,  etc
                Select shapes from selection (add to, subtract, replace)
                Select by name, with wildcard and regular expression support
                Shows quick select sets, add ability to select them and modify
                   current selection by add, subtract, replace
                Conditional selection
                    property   operator   number

    Create physically accurate rendering
        A tool to automatically setup Mental ray to give accurate renders
        
    UDK export tools
                    
    Write custom connect components that selects the new components!
    Quick select sets seem to be able to remember the old components
    so just make a quickselect set of the old components
    then select every new components that isn't in that quick select set.
    Then OpenMayToolbox connect won't be as important.
    
    Cleanup hotkeys code involving file paths and copying/moving
    
    Rewrite roadkill launcher using popen
    
    SelectTextureBorderEdges has old style code (maya.cmds etc)
        modernize it to use pymel and new Utils
