Make a copy of the ies file for each light
that you want different "spotlight" settings for.

Load those files onto VRay IES lights.

Note that you can change the light source
size and shape.  It's not really worth adjusting
the size and shape in the IES file itself.
You can use the VRay light shape settings to
do that.

Make sure you turn on "soft shadows" for the IES
light, otherwise it will act like an infinitely
small point light.

To change the spread and pattern in the file,
edit the lines that contain the numbers.
The last line with a row of numbers in it is
the intensities.

If you go up two lines, you can find the angles
that are used for those intensities.

Thus, if intensities is line 7, then angles is line 5.
This is the case in the adjustable starter file.

You can edit the pairs.  Don't change the angles
at 0 or 90 degrees, and I recommend that 90 is
0.0 (80 being 0.0 can help too.

In my tests, I did not have to refresh the file in Maya
for VRay to pick up the changes.  As soon as I edited
the test file and saved it, the changes were picked up right away.



In the line that looks like this:
1 -1 1 6 1 1 2 -0.045 -0.045 0

If you want to change the number of pairs
of angle/intensity, change the fourth number
("6" in the above example) to the number
of pairs you are using.

Make sure that you actually have that many pairs.
