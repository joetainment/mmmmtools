MmmmTools - Usability Improvements For Maya
Copyright 2008  -  Joseph Crawford

Most of the MmmmTools Files are in the MmmmTools folder.
For more information, see the MmmmTools website:

MmmmTools is Free Software licensed under the G.P.L.

Also note that this distribution of MmmmTools includes various
other Free Software, which is not actually part of MmmmTools
but is distributed along with it, in order to make
its installation and use easier and more complete.

To install MmmmTools, simply place all the files and folders
from the MmmmTools archive into the scripts folder of your
Maya version.

ex:

c:\users\joe\documents\maya\2016\scripts\

The files and folders should go directly into that folder.   So you
should end up with files like the following...

c:\users\joe\documents\maya\2016\scripts\MmmmTools    (folder)
c:\users\joe\documents\maya\2016\scripts\MmmmTools.ini
c:\users\joe\documents\maya\2016\scripts\MmmmTools-defaults.ini
c:\users\joe\documents\maya\2016\scripts\userSetup.mel
etc...


MmmmTools has been used and tested with many versions of Maya.
However, the current version may not work on older Maya versions.
Please see the website for more information.
