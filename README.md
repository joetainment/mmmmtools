Mmmm Makes Maya Marvelous

Usability and Efficiency Enhancements For Maya

## About

MmmmTools is a script (or really, a system of scripts) for Maya that adds a lot of functionality to the main toolset. It is used very widely by both individual artists and studios working on film, television, vfx and game production.  It is near certain that you've seen blockbuster movies, tv shows, or games where MmmmTools was used at least a little bit in production, since a large number of major studios have artists using MmmmTools on a regular basis.  The software has a five star rating on Creative Crash, and has been downloaded tens of thousands of times from the official website.
